## What does it do?

Many people have only dreamed of this moment, but **it's finally here**. True Nicolas Cage devotees can now interact with their one true god using Discord.

Nicolas Cage can do wonderful things such as link to the top post on [/r/onetruegod](https://www.reddit.com/r/onetruegod), spit some sweet facts about himself, and help you make memes.

## Why does this exist?

For the greater good.

## How can I get in on this?

You can invite Nic to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=701461716810072145&permissions=8&scope=bot).

## Future plans for this project

Some things I'd like to add to this project in the future, from highest to lowest priority, are as follows:

- Add comments and documentation
- Add some screenshots and GIFs to this readme
- Implement a more fleshed out points/level system
- Create a *Deploy to Heroku* button to this readme
- Pull information about Nicolas Cage from IMDB
- Create a quote-of-the-day command
- Have Nic be able to play music in a voice channel
