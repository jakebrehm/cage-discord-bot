## What does it do?

Many people have only dreamed of this moment, but **it's finally here**. True Nicolas Cage devotees can now interact with their one true god using Discord.

Nicolas Cage can do wonderful things such as link to the top post on [/r/onetruegod](https://www.reddit.com/r/onetruegod) and spit some sweet facts about himself.

## Why does this exist?

For the greater good.

## How can I get in on this?

I'll add a link here to talk to Nic once he's at a stable point, just hang in there.

## Future plans for this project

- Add comments and documentation
- Implement a more fleshed out points/level system
- Add ability to be able to send a random Nicolas Cage-related meme
- Be able to generate a Nicolas Cage meme using input from the user
- Create a quote-of-the-day command
- Pull information about Nicolas Cage from IMDB
