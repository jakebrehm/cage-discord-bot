# Nicolas Cage Discord Bot
A Nicolas Cage-inspired bot for Discord.

# What does it do?

**Many people have only dreamed of this moment,** but it's finally here. True Nicolas Cage devotees can now interact with their one true god using Discord.

Nicolas Cage can do wonderful things such as link to the top post on [/r/onetruegod](https://www.reddit.com/r/onetruegod) and spit some sweet facts about himself.

# Why does this exist?

For the greater good.

# Future plans for this project

- Implement a more fleshed out points/level system
- Add ability to be able to send a random Nicolas Cage-related meme
- Be able to generate a Nicolas Cage meme using input from the user
- Create a quote-of-the-day command
